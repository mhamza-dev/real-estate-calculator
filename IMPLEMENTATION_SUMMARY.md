   - IRR projections (hold period, growth rates)
   - Monthly/annual rent toggle
   - Real-time validation

2. **ResultsScreen** - Displays:
   - All calculated metrics (NOI, Cap Rate, GRM, DSCR, LTV, Cash-on-Cash, IRR)
   - Expandable metric explanations
   - Cash flow table
   - Back navigation

3. **RecentScreen** - Local storage of calculations:
   - List saved calculations
   - Delete functionality
   - Timestamp display

4. **AboutScreen** - Educational content:
   - Metric definitions
   - Formula explanations
   - Disclaimers

5. **SettingsScreen** - App settings placeholder

### 6. Supporting Infrastructure ✅
**Location:** `src/lib/`

- ✅ **Storage:** AsyncStorage wrapper for local persistence
- ✅ **Formatting:** Currency, percentage, and number formatting utilities
- ✅ **Theme:** Light/dark theme infrastructure
- ✅ **Hooks:** 
  - `useCalculator()` - Calculation logic
  - `useTheme()` - Theme management

### 7. Navigation ✅
**Location:** `src/navigation/`

- ✅ React Navigation v6 with Stack Navigator
- ✅ Type-safe navigation with TypeScript
- ✅ Configured for Calculator, Results, Recent, About, and Settings screens

### 8. Project Structure ✅

## Sample Test Case Validation

The calculator passes the provided acceptance test with the following inputs and outputs:

**Input:**
- Purchase Price: $1,200,000
- Annual Rent: $108,000
- Operating Expenses: $24,000
- Vacancy Rate: 0%
- Loan Amount: $780,000 (65% LTV)
- Interest Rate: 6.5%
- Amortization: 30 years
- Closing Costs: 3%
- Hold Period: 5 years
- Rent Growth: 2% annually
- Exit Cap Rate: 7.25%
- Selling Costs: 3%

**Expected Outputs (with tolerances):**
- ✅ NOI: $84,000 (exact match)
- ✅ Cap Rate: 7.00% (exact match)
- ✅ GRM: 11.11 (tolerance: ±0.02)
- ✅ Annual Debt Service: $59,161.57 (tolerance: ±$100)
- ✅ DSCR: 1.42 (tolerance: ±0.02)
- ✅ LTV: 65% (exact match)
- ✅ Cash-on-Cash Return: 5.45% (tolerance: ±0.05%)
- ✅ IRR: 7.30% (tolerance: ±0.10%)

## Build Instructions

### Development
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm start
npm run ios      # Run on iOS
npm run android  # Run on Android
npm run web      # Run on web
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test
```

### Building for Production
```bash
# iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Android
eas build --platform android --profile production

# Web
npm run build:web
```

## Next Steps (Enhancement Opportunities)

While the core functionality is complete, these features could be added as enhancements:

1. **PDF Export** - Generate PDF reports of calculations
2. **Share Functionality** - Share calculation results
3. **Dark Mode** - Implement dark theme
4. **Currency Selection** - Support multiple currencies
5. **Additional Charts** - Enhanced cash flow visualization
6. **Import/Export** - Import/export calculation data
7. **More Metrics** - Add equity multiple, yield, etc.

## Known Limitations

1. **IRR Convergence**: Some complex cash flow patterns may not converge exactly and require approximations
2. **Expense Growth**: Currently simplified (rent growth applied uniformly)
3. **PDF Export**: Not yet implemented (infrastructure ready)
4. **Dark Mode**: Theme infrastructure exists but UI not fully implemented

## Conclusion

A **production-ready** commercial real estate investment calculator has been successfully implemented with:
- ✅ Comprehensive financial calculations
- ✅ Passing unit tests with sample acceptance test
- ✅ Clean, accessible UI
- ✅ Local persistence
- ✅ Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web)
- ✅ Type-safe TypeScript implementation
- ✅ Modern development tooling

The app is ready for development, testing, and deployment to TestFlight and Play Store.
